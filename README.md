# Working with Web3.py within SimpleStorage contract
This project was my first contact with Web3.py. Before that I played around with Remix IDE and created SimpleStorage contract.

## My learning experience within project
1. Compilation of smart contract to bytecode to enables EVM to read it
2. Ganache ecosystem
3. Building a transaction (build/sign/send)
